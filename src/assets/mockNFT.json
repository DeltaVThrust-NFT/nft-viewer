The video is a short capture of the live model. The metadata also contains a poster, which is a still rendering of the Atom optimised for print.\n\nPOW NFTs are the first ever mineable NFT, and are mined with an increasing level of difficulty using Proof of Work – a fundamental feature of blockchain first described in Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin whitepaper. When a POW NFT is mined, a unique and increasingly rare ERC-721 token is created. The mining process prevents front-running and network congestion while maintaining security, and parallel mining-difficulty and price-demand-curves create natural, market-driven scarcity. \n",
